# Melanoma Detection Assignment
> This project builds a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. 
It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the 
potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- This project builds a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow to detect Melanoma which is a type of skin cancer.
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. 
A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). 
The data set contains the following diseases:

Actinic keratosis
Basal cell carcinoma
Dermatofibroma
Melanoma
Nevus
Pigmented benign keratosis
Seborrheic keratosis
Squamous cell carcinoma
Vascular lesion

## Conclusions
- Model is able to achieve 73% accuracy with training and validation data both.
- Model is neither overfitting nor underfitting.


## Technologies Used
- tensorflow
- numpy
- panda
- matplotlib
- augmentor
